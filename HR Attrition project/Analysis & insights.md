## 📊 Analysis & Insights

### Excel / Power Query Analysis

The HR dataset contained **5,000 employee records**. Excel and Power Query were used to clean and prepare the data before analysis.

The cleaning process included:

- Removing extra spaces from text fields
- Standardizing Department and Job Role values
- Checking missing values
- Correcting data types
- Validating Salary, Attendance, Performance Rating and Job Satisfaction
- Checking Attrition values and Exit Reasons

The cleaned dataset was then imported into MySQL for further analysis.

## 🗄️ SQL Analysis

The cleaned data was divided into three relational tables:

- Employees
- Performance
- Attrition

Primary and foreign keys were used to connect the tables through `Employee_ID`.

SQL analysis was performed to evaluate employee salary, performance, attendance, overtime, job satisfaction and attrition.
